Practicing for the OMP'19
===================================

I will upload here the solutions to the problems with which I practice.

OMP'18-E
===================================
Bididibus consists of blocks of uniform width and height. Bididibusian orography is described by a series of symbols, from left to right, indicating that the land rises one unit (represented by "/"), descends one unit (represented by "\"), or it is flat (represented by "_").
Your task is to count the number of plateaus in the map. A valid plateau should have: 3 or more consecutive rising units; 1 or more flat units; and 3 or more consecutive descending units.
